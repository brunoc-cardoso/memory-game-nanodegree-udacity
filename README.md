Third udacity front end fundamentals course design.

## How the game works
### Rules
The game consists of selecting equal pairs of cards with the least number of possible moves.
The classification of stars depends on the number of movements performed.

The game starts with 3 dark stars which means you have them. When they turn white it is because it has been lost.
3 stars = 20 or fewer moves
2 stars = between 21 or 30 moves
1 star = more than 31 moves

The time is only to know the period you spent during the match

Clicking on the `Restart game` button will restart the game.
When all combinations are made, a screen will appear showing the match data, such as time spent, stars conquered and number of moves.
Clicking the `New Game` button will start the game again from the beginning
